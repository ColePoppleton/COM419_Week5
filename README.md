# COM419_Week3

This week you are going to use what you've learned in the videos and in lecture to create a layout for a website - which you will also style.

I have released a pdf containing a design - which you can find here:

[Click here to see the design.](https://github.com/darrened/COM419/blob/main/Week3/Design.pdf)

Create the designed website using that document as an aid. 
I have also provided the images used for the website, which can be found here:

I have provided some notes with the design to give you an idea of some of the styles I applied, but you are free to change the design as you see fit.

Please note that I developed the website on a fairly small screen. Bigger screens (or very small screens) are likely to have to change things to make it look better. We will look in to how to adapt to different screen sizes next week

You do not have to write the content from the design if you do not wish to. You can use random filler text to save on typing

Task 2
Hopefully you have succeeded in putting together the website from the design.

I have provided you with the barebones of a design, now it's your chance to exercise your creative side:

Style the website further! Change colours, add background images, apply a hover effect to the navigation bar - It's up to you, just have a go at making the website look nicer.

# COM419_Week4

Last week, you built a webpage using positioning techniques (mainly flex) to control the layout.

This week is a continuation of last weeks task

If you adjust the browser size whilst previewing last weeks task, you will find that (in most cases) it will adjust to the changes quite well - however there will be extremes (i.e. a really small screen) in which the website will not look good at all.

Your task for this week is to modify the webpage and ensure that it adapts appropriately, regardless of screen-size.

You have complete freedom about how the website will look at different sizes, I will expect you to practice media queries however.
